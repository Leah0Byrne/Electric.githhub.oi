	<p>Genre: Indie Rock<br> Quick History<br>Born on August 28, 1986 in Camberwell, England, Florence Welch was raised in a family of writers and academics. She took to music at an early age and created her own band, which she named Florence and the Machine. The band met with success beginning in 2006, and became famous a few years later with their debut album, Lungs (2009). On the album, Welch's voice can be heard on popular songs such as "Kiss with a Fist" and "Shake It Out." In 2011, Florence and the Machine released its second studio album, Ceremonials.<br>Welch returned to top form with Florence and the Machine's third album, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful, which was released in June 2015. In advance of the record's debut, she had to overcome some challenges. Welch broke her foot while performing at the Coachella musical festival that April. But she didn't let that injury slow her down. That May, Welch wowed audiences as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. She later earned a Grammy nomination for "What Kind of Man" for best rock song. </p>
