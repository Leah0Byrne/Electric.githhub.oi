	<p>Genre: Pop<br> Quick History<br>Years &amp; Years initially came together in 2010 in London when multi-instrumentalist/producers Michael Goldsworthy and Emre Türkmen met online while looking to start a band. They eventually added vocalist and actor Alexander after hearing him singing at a friend's house while taking a shower. The trio's keyboard- and electronics-based sound first gained exposure when the single "Traps" was released on Kitsuné Music in 2013. The group's second EP, Real, came out in February 2014, and with some impressive live dates under their belts, Years &amp; Years announced they had signed a deal with Polydor.<br> Their first major-label single, Take Shelter, appeared in August 2014, followed by a collaboration with the Magician on Sunlight a month later and the release of Desire in November. In 2015, on the heels of winning the prestigious BBC Sound Of award, Years &amp; Years released their debut full-length album, Communion. The well-received album debuted at number one in the U.K. and peaked in the Top 50 of the U.S. Billboard 200. The following year, they were nominated for four BRIT Awards and headlined their own tour, which included a sold-out show at London's Wembley Arena. Also that year, they contributed the single "Meteorite" to the Bridget Jones' Baby soundtrack</p>
