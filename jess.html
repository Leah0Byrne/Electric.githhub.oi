	<p>Genre:Dance Music<br>Quick History<br>With a deep and soulful tone similar to Jessie J and Adele, Grammy-winning singer/songwriter Jess Glynne made her early-2010s breakthrough in the U.K. as the voice of chart-topping electronic dance tracks "My Love" with Route 94 and "Rather Be" with chamber-music-meets-house act Clean Bandit. As a solo artist, she scored additional chart-toppers and a number one album with her 2015 debut, I Cry When I Laugh.<br>After weeks spent writing in Los Angeles, she retreated to the countryside for additional recording sessions alongside a team of her closest collaborators. She wrote the majority of the record during that time, including the lead singles "These Days" with Rudimental, Macklemore, and Dan Caplen and "I'll Be There," which became her seventh number one. The album, Always in Between, arrived in October 2018 and topped the U.K. charts.<br>Glynne was born and raised north of London, singing from a young age. Staying closely connected to the music industry via odd jobs and college courses, she eventually signed a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013. From there, she contributed vocals to a number of key tracks, which helped launch her career into the mainstream. Route 94's "My Love" topped charts in the U.K. and Scotland, finding the ears of Clean Bandit, who recruited Glynne for 2014's "Rather Be," which became a global smash and took home a Grammy for Best Dance Recording.</p>
